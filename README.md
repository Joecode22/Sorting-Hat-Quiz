# Sorting-Hat-Quiz
The Harry Potter Sorting Hat Quiz - a Codecademy student project in C++

## Overview
This project presents a delightful console-based quiz application inspired by the magical Sorting Hat from the Harry Potter series. Users are asked a series of questions, each contributing to a score for one of the four Hogwarts houses: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. The house with the highest score at the end of the quiz is deemed the best fit for the user.

## Features

- **Interactive Quiz Format:** Users interact with the quiz through a console interface, responding to prompts to answer questions.
- **Dynamic Scoring System:** Each answer influences the user's alignment with the four Hogwarts houses, dynamically updating scores based on responses.
- **Input Validation:** The program includes input validation to ensure users enter valid responses, improving user experience and program stability.
- **Final House Assignment:** At the end of the quiz, the program calculates the highest-scoring house and "sorts" the user accordingly.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Program:** Use a C++ compiler to compile the source code.
2. **Run the Executable:** Launch the compiled program to start the quiz.
3. **Answer Questions:** Respond to each question by typing a number corresponding to your choice and press Enter.
